This repository includes a remake and reimplementation of the board game RISK with modified rules and board. This program is created from the mixed work of Zach Allen, Rachit Bhargava, Hunter Copp, Sameh Hamadeh, and Haowei Li.

The game is currently not complete but has working features such as:
- Creating players
- Getting assigned armies, territories, and random turns
- Board is setup with a map including the territories and the armies it includes

The rest of the game and features are soon to come. The final game will include all the features and such of a regular RISK game and will be completely playable through running the program in this repo.
